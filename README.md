Description
-----------

Light Savers is a 2 player 3D top-down game in the horror genre, set in an abandoned research facility. The game has four shadow monster enemies, each with differing strenghts and skills that spawn in the shadows. The players cast light from their torches, creating areas of light that monsters cannot spawn in. This is the core game mechanic, and encourages players to stick together and move quickly.

The LightSavers project requires XNA Game Studio on Visual Studio 2010 or higher.
