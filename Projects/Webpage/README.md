### According to the brief:
Each project team is required to produce a web page for the CS game archive:
http://pubs.cs.uct.ac.za/gamesproj/

This is a requirement and is due before the final game hand-in. Failure to submit this will result in a 30% penalty on your final Game project mark. The format for your web page submission is as follows (please see above link for examples):

* a single ZIP file containing the Game project web page and accompanying data
* the data that should be included in each ZIP file is:
* a text summary of the game: including Game Title, names of developers and artists, genre, game style (e.g. multiplayer), distinguishing features, implementation platform etc
* a single PNG/JPG screenshot which you think shows off something cool about your game. This can be a collage of images, as shown in examples
* a single web page (see below)
* the single web page should be called index.html
* web page must be static: no PHP, ASP, server side JS etc
* the page should be structured as shown in the examples: contain a text introduction, screenshots, notes on game play and preferably embedded YouTube or Vimeo clips showing how the game plays. You can include any other relevant information.
